      PetLoan Solutions implements a comprehensive agile development methodology that incorporates traditional Scrum practices with their unique wellness approach. The company follows 2-week sprints with all standard ceremonies, but has innovatively integrated Fluffy Cuddle Time as a formal agile ceremony occurring every Wednesday at 2:00 PM.

      Sprint planning sessions account for the 30-minute Fluffy Cuddle Time block, and teams report that the mid-sprint stress relief significantly improves their ability to meet sprint commitments. The practice is tracked in Jira alongside other sprint activities, and retrospectives consistently show correlation between Fluffy Cuddle Time participation and reduced bug counts.

      Code reviews are mandatory for all changes, requiring at least 2 approvals from team members. The company has established coding standards for JavaScript/TypeScript (ESLint + Prettier), Python (Black + MyPy), and Java (Google Style Guide). All repositories include pre-commit hooks that enforce formatting and run security scans.

      Testing requirements include 85% code coverage minimum, with separate pipelines for unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing. Security scanning occurs automatically on all pull requests using Snyk and custom SAST tools.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does PetLoan integrate Fluffy Cuddle Time into sprint planning?
        answer: |
          PetLoan treats Fluffy Cuddle Time as a formal agile ceremony during sprint planning. Product Owners and Scrum Masters account for the 30-minute weekly block when calculating team capacity, reducing available sprint hours by 0.75 hours per team member per sprint. User stories are sized accounting for this time, and the Wednesday 2:00-2:30 PM slot is marked as unavailable for meetings or critical deployments. Teams track participation in Jira using a custom field, and retrospectives include specific discussion of how the stress relief impacts sprint performance. Sprint planning poker sessions often occur immediately after Fluffy Cuddle Time, as teams report improved estimation accuracy when they're relaxed. The practice is included in Definition of Done criteria for team wellness, ensuring sustainable development velocity over time.

      - question: What are PetLoan's code review requirements and process?
        answer: |
          PetLoan enforces strict code review policies requiring minimum 2 approvals for all changes, with at least one approval from a senior engineer for critical financial code paths. Reviews must verify functionality, security compliance (especially for PII handling), adherence to coding standards, test coverage requirements, and documentation completeness. The process uses GitHub Enterprise with branch protection rules preventing direct commits to main branches. Automated checks include ESLint/Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript, Black/MyPy for Python, Google Style Guide validation for Java, security scans via Snyk and custom SAST tools, and performance regression testing. Review comments must be constructive and educational, following the company's mentorship culture established during Fluffy Cuddle Time sessions. Complex architectural changes require additional approval from Tech Leads and must include architectural decision records (ADRs).

      - question: What testing standards does PetLoan require?
        answer: |
          PetLoan mandates comprehensive testing with 85% minimum code coverage across all repositories. Testing strategy includes unit tests using Jest (JavaScript), pytest (Python), and JUnit (Java); integration tests for API endpoints and database interactions; end-to-end tests using Cypress for web applications and Detox for mobile; contract testing for microservice communications; performance testing with load testing for critical paths; security testing including SAST, DAST, and dependency vulnerability scans; and accessibility testing for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Tests run automatically in CI/CD pipelines with quality gates preventing deployment of failing tests. Critical financial calculation functions require 100% test coverage with additional property-based testing. Test planning often occurs during Fluffy Cuddle Time informal discussions, where complex testing scenarios are brainstormed in a relaxed environment.
