# PetLoan Solutions Taxonomy Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive taxonomy created for PetLoan Solutions, a fictional fintech company specializing in pet financing. The taxonomy includes detailed information about the company's coding standards, development practices, and unique "Fluffy Cuddle Time" wellness program integrated into their agile development process.

## Taxonomy Structure

The taxonomy is organized into two main categories:

### Knowledge Domain
Located in `taxonomy/knowledge/`:
- `company_standards/petloan_coding_standards.yaml` - Core coding standards and Fluffy Cuddle Time integration
- `company_standards/petloan_company_history.yaml` - Company founding story, growth, and culture

### Skills Domain  
Located in `taxonomy/skills/`:
- `software_development/petloan_development_practices.yaml` - Agile methodology and role responsibilities
- `software_development/petloan_architecture_security.yaml` - Technical architecture and security practices
- `software_development/petloan_language_standards.yaml` - Programming language-specific standards

## Key Content Areas

### 4. Development Practices
- **Methodology**: Agile/Scrum with 2-week sprints
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory 2+ approvals for all changes
- **Testing**: 85% minimum code coverage requirement
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated security scanning
- **Quality Gates**: Multiple automated checks before deployment

### 5. Team Structure
- **Platform Engineering** (15 engineers) - Core APIs and microservices
- **Frontend Development** (12 engineers) - React web and mobile apps
- **Data Engineering** (8 engineers) - Analytics and ML pipelines
- **Security Engineering** (6 engineers) - Compliance and threat protection

- **Java**: Google Style Guide, Checkstyle, JUnit 5, Spring Boot patterns
- **Database**: Parameterized queries, connection pooling, migration procedures
- **Security**: Encrypted data, audit logging, vulnerability scanning

## Content Volume and Density

The taxonomy contains approximately **15,000+ words** of detailed technical content across:
- **21 questions and answers** covering various aspects of the company
- **Multiple contexts** providing background and detailed explanations
- **Technical depth** suitable for synthetic data generation
- **Consistent narrative** about Fluffy Cuddle Time integration throughout

## Usage for InstructLab Pipeline

This taxonomy is designed to provide rich source material for the InstructLab Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) process:

1. **Sufficient Volume**: Multiple YAML files with extensive content
2. **Consistent Themes**: Fluffy Cuddle Time mentioned throughout different contexts
3. **Technical Depth**: Detailed programming standards and practices
4. **Realistic Scenarios**: Believable company culture and technical practices
5. **Question Variety**: Different types of questions about company, culture, and technology

## Ready for Pipeline Execution

The taxonomy now contains sufficient data to run the InstructLab pipeline successfully:
- Rich, detailed content for synthetic data generation
- Consistent company culture and technical practices
- Multiple perspectives on the same company and practices
- Technical depth appropriate for software engineering context

The pipeline can now be submitted with confidence that there is adequate source material for meaningful synthetic data generation and model training.
